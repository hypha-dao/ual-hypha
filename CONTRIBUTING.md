## Reporting An Issue

If you're about to raise an issue because you think you've found a problem with UAL Seeds, or you'd like to make a request for a new feature in the codebase, or any other reasonâ€¦ please read this first.

The GitHub issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [feature requests](#feature-requests), and [submitting pull requests](#submitting-pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **search for existing issues**. Help us keep duplicate issues to a minimum by checking to see if someone has already reported your problem or requested your idea.

* Please **be civil**. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others. See also our [Contributor Code of Conduct](#conduct).

### Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

1. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; look for [closed issues in the
   current milestone](https://github.com/hypha-dao/ual-hypha/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) or try to reproduce it
   using the latest `main` branch.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the details of your environment and relevant tests that demonstrate the failure.

[Report a bug](https://github.com/hypha-dao/ual-hypha/issues/new?title=Bug%3A)

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. Before you submit one be sure to have:

1. **Use the GitHub search** and check the feature hasn't already been requested.
1. Take a moment to think about whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
1. Remember, it's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's leaders of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use case and why it is likely to be common.

### Change Requests

Change requests cover both architectural and functional changes to how UAL Seeds works. If you have an idea for a new or different dependency, a refactor, or an improvement to a feature, etc - please be sure to:

1. **Use the GitHub search** and check someone else didn't get there first
1. Take a moment to think about the best way to make a case for, and explain what you're thinking. Are you sure this shouldn't really be
   a [bug report](#bug-reports) or a [feature request](#feature-requests)?  Is it really one idea or is it many? What's the context? What problem are you solving? Why is what you are suggesting better than what's already there?

## Working on UAL Seeds

Code contributions are welcome and encouraged! If you are looking for a good place to start, check out the [good first issue](https://github.com/hypha-dao/ual-hypha/labels/good%20first%20issue) label in GitHub issues.

Also, please follow these guidelines when submitting code:

### Feature Branches

To get it out of the way:

- **[develop](https://github.com/hypha-dao/ual-hypha/tree/develop)** is the development branch. All work on the next release happens here so you should generally branch off `develop`. Do **NOT** use this branch for a production site.
- **[master](https://github.com/hypha-dao/ual-hypha/tree/master)** contains the latest release of UAL Seeds. This branch may be used in production. Do **NOT** use this branch to work on UAL Seeds's source.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are awesome. If you're looking to raise a PR for something which doesn't have an open issue, please think carefully about [raising an issue](#reporting-an-issue) which your PR can close, especially if you're fixing a bug. This makes it more likely that there will be enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and merged.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Never underestimate just how useful quality assurance is. If you're looking to get involved with the code base and don't know where to start, checking out and testing a pull request is one of the most useful things you could do.

Essentially, [check out the latest develop branch](#working-on-ual-hypha), take it for a spin, and if you find anything odd, please follow the [bug report guidelines](#bug-reports) and let us know!
